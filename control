Description: DosBox Game Launcher
 A free, open-source, multi-platform frontend for DOSBox. DBGL makes setting up your DOS games a breeze, and playing them a joy.
 Introduction DOSBox
 .
 DOSBox is a great emulator for playing your DOS games. It's feature-rich, highly compatible and easy to operate. But if you want to use it with multiple games, or want to be able to try out different DOSBox versions, things might become a bit complicated. Also, not everyone is willing to learn about using DOSBox, or how to install a game using a DOS game installer. That's when a frontend like DBGL might help out. It will get your games organized and presented such that you can have more fun actually playing them. And with the provided GamePackArchives you'll be up and running in minutes.
